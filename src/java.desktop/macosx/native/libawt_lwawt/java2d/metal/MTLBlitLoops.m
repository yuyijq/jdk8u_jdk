 * "Surface" surfaces.
 *
 * This method is used to transform the source surface into the destination.
 * Pixel rectangles cannot be arbitrarily transformed (without the
 * GL_EXT_pixel_transform extension, which is not supported on most modern
 * hardware).  However, texture mapped quads do respect the GL_MODELVIEW
 * transform matrix, so we use textures here to perform the transform
 * operation.  This method uses a tile-based approach in which a small
 * subregion of the source surface is copied into a cached texture tile.  The
 * texture tile is then mapped into the appropriate location in the
 * destination surface.
 *
 * REMIND: this only works well using GL_NEAREST for the filtering mode
 *         (GL_LINEAR causes visible stitching problems between tiles,
 *         but this can be fixed by making use of texture borders)
