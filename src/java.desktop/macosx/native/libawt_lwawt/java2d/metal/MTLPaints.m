 * This code takes a "dist" value as input (as calculated earlier by the
 * LGP/RGP-specific code) in the range [0,1] and produces a texture
 * coordinate value "tc" that represents the position of the chosen color
 * in the one-dimensional gradient texture (also in the range [0,1]).
 *
 * One naive way to implement this would be to iterate through the fractions
 * to figure out in which interval "dist" falls, and then compute the
 * relative distance between the two nearest stops.  This approach would
 * require an "if" check on every iteration, and it is best to avoid
 * conditionals in fragment shaders for performance reasons.  Also, one might
 * be tempted to use a break statement to jump out of the loop once the
 * interval was found, but break statements (and non-constant loop bounds)
 * are not natively available on most graphics hardware today, so that is
 * a non-starter.
 *
 * The more optimal approach used here avoids these issues entirely by using
 * an accumulation function that is equivalent to the process described above.
 * The scaleFactors array is pre-initialized at enable time as follows:
 *     scaleFactors[i] = 1.0 / (fractions[i+1] - fractions[i]);
 *
 * For each iteration, we subtract fractions[i] from dist and then multiply
 * that value by scaleFactors[i].  If we are within the target interval,
 * this value will be a fraction in the range [0,1] indicating the relative
 * distance between fraction[i] and fraction[i+1].  If we are below the
 * target interval, this value will be negative, so we clamp it to zero
 * to avoid accumulating any value.  If we are above the target interval,
 * the value will be greater than one, so we clamp it to one.  Upon exiting
 * the loop, we will have accumulated zero or more 1.0's and a single
 * fractional value.  This accumulated value tells us the position of the
 * fragment color in the one-dimensional gradient texture, i.e., the
 * texcoord called "tc".
